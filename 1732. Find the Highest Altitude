Problem : 1732. Find the Highest Altitude

There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.

You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i​​​​​​ and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.


Time Complexity :: O(N)
Space Complexity :: O(1)

CODE::
class Solution {
public:
    int largestAltitude(vector<int>& gain) {
        int ans = max(0,gain[0]);
        for(int i =1 ;i<gain.size() ; i++){gain[i] = gain[i-1] + gain[i];ans = max(ans , gain[i]);}
        return ans;
    }
};
