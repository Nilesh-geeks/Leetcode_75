Problem :: 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.


time Complexity :: O(N)
Space Complexity :: O(N) // due to recursion

CODE :: 
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if(!root)return 0 ;
        return 1 + max(maxDepth(root->left) , maxDepth(root->right));
    }
};
